# Glitch

## Version Control

We will be using GitHub for version control for the [project](https://github.com/16ajbm/Glitch).

We will be following the [Git Flow](https://gamemakerblog.com/2023/07/13/how-to-use-git-flow-for-game-development/) branching model.

### Important Repository Rules
I have to write these out because they cannot be enforced by GitHub unless we have a Team membership. They are:
- **DO NOT** push directly to `main`
- **DO NOT** push directly to `develop`
- **DO NOT** merge Pull Requests without approval/review from another team member
- Be careful and consider what you are intending before using `--force` on any Git command, that can get messy **very** fast

## Project Organization

TODO:

- Determine file structure
- Determine file naming scheme
- Determine code naming scheme
